  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  #  w100 Thin, the least thick
  #  w200 Extra-light
  #  w300 Light
  #  w400 Normal / regular / plain
  #  w500 Medium
  #  w600 Semi-bold
  #  w700 Bold
  #  w800 Extra-bold
  #  w900 Black, the most thick

  fonts:
    - family: Matter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/matter/Matter-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/matter/Matter-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
